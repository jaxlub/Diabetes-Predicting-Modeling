# Final Project for Data Visualization 
Welcome to my interactive shiny app on Diabetes!

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshaydattatraykhare/diabetes-dataset?resource=download

  - Pregnancies: To express the Number of pregnancies

  - Glucose: To express the Glucose level in blood

  - BloodPressure: To express the Blood pressure measurement

  - SkinThickness: To express the thickness of the skin

  - Insulin: To express the Insulin level in blood

  - BMI: To express the Body mass index
  
  - DiabetesPedigreeFunction: To express the Diabetes percentage

  - Age: To express the age

  - Outcome: To express the final result 1 is Yes and 0 is No
  
  
  Ideas - 
    data visuals tab
      one tab for plotting 2 against each other with coloring by outcome - Scatterplot matrix
  
  
  
  Removed all non-0 data points except pregnancies - models got better - nulls were input as 0 so they should be removed before any visuals or data modeling
    
  Maybe need more visuals...
    
    
TODO - BLOG POST!
